Standard deviation:
The standard deviation is found by taking the mean of the squared distances between each data point and the mean, 
and then taking the square root of that. For example, if you have the values 1,2,3,4,5, then:
The mean is (1+2+3+4+5)/5=3
The differences between each data point and the mean are -2,-1,0,1,2
The squares of those differences are 4,1,0,1,4
The mean of those is 2   (= Variance)
So the standard deviation is sqrt(2) or about 1.41

Mode: 
Value that appears most often. [1,2,3,4,5] has no mode 

Standard Error:
Variability of sample means,   = sigma / sqrt(n)  , where n nr of samples.
Take a huge number of random samples from the same population and calculate the mean for each of those samples, then the distribution of the sample means will be normally distributed with a mean that is equal to the true population mean. This is a simplification of the central limit theorem. The standard deviation of this sampling distribution is the standard error.
standard error of the sampling distribution can be interpreted as the 'average distance between a sample mean and the population mean'

Significance/alpha level:
Is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true  (usually set to 5%)

p-value:
Measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference.
Throw away null hypothesis if p < alpha
